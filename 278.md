# Unsafe block variables handling.

## Summary

Through-out the contracts the block variables are treated as given below.

BlockNumber - uint256, uint128 and uint64

timestamp - uint256, uint128 and uint64

when we see the output root proposal, the block varibales are treated as uint128.

     * @custom:field outputRoot    Hash of the L2 output.
     * @custom:field timestamp     Timestamp of the L1 block that the output root was submitted in.
     * @custom:field l2BlockNumber L2 block number that the output corresponds to.
     */
    struct OutputProposal {
        bytes32 outputRoot;
        uint128 timestamp;
        uint128 l2BlockNumber;
    }

whereas while feeding the L1 datas, the block varibles are treated as uint64.

    function setL1BlockValues(
        uint64 _number,
        uint64 _timestamp,
        uint256 _basefee,
        bytes32 _hash,
        uint64 _sequenceNumber,
        bytes32 _batcherHash,
        uint256 _l1FeeOverhead,
        uint256 _l1FeeScalar
    ) external {

In some places the variables are compared with different range value.  one example is from `OptimismPortal.sol`

inside the function `proveWithdrawalTransaction`,

        require(
            provenWithdrawal.timestamp == 0 ||
                (_l2OutputIndex == provenWithdrawal.l2OutputIndex &&
                    outputRoot != provenWithdrawal.outputRoot),
            "OptimismPortal: withdrawal hash has already been proven"
        );

`_l2OutputIndex  is uint256` but `provenWithdrawal.l2OutputIndex is uint128`

Theoretically speaking, the possibility  of the reaching the value to uint128 or uint64 is infeasible.

but technically it is possible. 

The optimism is re-organize itself when the Ethereum reorganized.

but what if Ethereum foundation decides to fork the chain which could start the block number from uint64  or uint128 value.

In this case, optimism can not cope itself due to these kind of data handling.

## Vulnerability Detail

Refer the summary section.

## Impact

The impact could be,

1. Optimism can not handle the reorganization when Ethereum does which start block number value starts from uint64 or uint128 max value.
2. When Ethereum's block number reaches more max value of uint128 or uint64.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

we  suggest to use the uint256 type of data for all the block varibles.
