# EOA Check is sidesteappable by transferingTo

## Summary

In spite of the EOA-Check for self-bridging, the EOA check is not applied to the `_to` argument of the Bridge Implementation

Meaning that end-users may mistakenly bridge to a contract, sidestepping the EOA check and potentially causing a loss of tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

The EOA check is sidestepped by using the `_to` field, which doesn't check that the recipient is not a contract

## Code Snippet

This applies to both StandardBridge and ERC721Bridge
