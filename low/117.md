# Minor: Incorrect and inconsistent storage gap

## Summary

The `ERC721Bridge` base contract is used by both the `L1ERC721Bridge` contract and the `L2ERC721Bridge` contract, and contains storage gap, including the spec of total storage slot of 50 in code comments. However, the actual storage gap in the contract is not 50. It appears that the developer has failed to recognize that `immutable` and `constant` variables do not take any storage slot, in arriving at the incorrect storage slot. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the contract `ERC721Bridge`, line 25 reserves 49 slots when the comment above says total of 50. Both `MESSENGER` and `OTHER_BRIDGE` are `immutable` and do not take any storage slot. 

## Impact

49 storage slots are reserved instead of the intended spec of 50 slots

## Recommendation

Change the length of the array in line 25 to 50 instead.
