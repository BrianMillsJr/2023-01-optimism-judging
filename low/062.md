# RLP encoding of deposit transaction does not follow specification

## Summary

A mismatch between what's specified for the RLP encoding of deposit transactions and the actual Solidity implementation.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`encodeDepositTransaction` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/Encoding.sol#L22) defined in the `Encoding` library` RLP encodes user deposit transactions. While in theory this function's implementation should follow the specification defined [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/specs/deposits.md#the-deposited-transaction-type), it does not.

Here's a table summarizing the differences between what's stated in the spec and what the actual implementation does.

|field position|From spec|From implementation|
|-|-|-|
|0|sourceHash|sourceHash|
|1|from|from|
|2|to|to|
|3|mint|mint|
|4|value|value|
|5|data|gasLimit|
|6|gasLimit|isSystemTransaction|
|7|-|data|

## Impact

As long as the RLP decoding follows the actual encoding used in implementation, there's no significant impact. Still worth fixing.

## Recommendation

Assuming the implementation follows what you're intending to do, then update the specs to match the code.
