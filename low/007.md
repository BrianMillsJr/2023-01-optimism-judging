# Unsafe ERC20 operation

## Summary

Unsafe ERC20 operation

## Vulnerability Detail

ERC20 operations might not be secure due to multiple implementations and vulnerabilities in the standard. It is advised to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 or, at least, wrap each operation in a `require` statement.

## Impact

ERC20 operations might not be secure due to multiple implementations and vulnerabilities in the standard.

## Code Snippet

```

## Recommendation

It is advised to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 or, at least, wrap each operation in a `require` statement.

Some examples from [](https://github.com/byterocket/c4-common-issues/blob/main/2-Low-Risk.md#l001---unsafe-erc20-operations) are:

use OpenZeppelin SafeERC20
```Solidity
import {SafeERC20} from "openzeppelin/token/utils/SafeERC20.sol";

// ...

IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```

or use `require`

```Solidity
bool success = IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
require(success, "ERC20 transfer failed");
```
