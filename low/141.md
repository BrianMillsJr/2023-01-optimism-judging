# Revert Messages: 2 inconsistent instances

## Summary

The linked below instances use a different contract name for their revert messages

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L2/L2ERC721Bridge.sol#L88-L89

```solidity
        require(_remoteToken != address(0), "ERC721Bridge: remote token cannot be address(0)");
```

No Contract Name
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/libraries/Bytes.sol#L27-L29

```solidity
            require(_length + 31 >= _length, "slice_overflow");
            require(_start + _length >= _start, "slice_overflow");
            require(_bytes.length >= _start + _length, "slice_outOfBounds");
```

Every other instance in the code is prefixed by the exact ContractName
