# Dangerous Payable Function

## Summary
Any ETH mistakenly sent along with ERC20 bridging calls will be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
`finalizeDeposit()` and `_initiateWithdrawal()` (`withdraw()` + `withdrawTo()`) have code paths that require Ether to be sent to them and therefore those two functions have the payable modifier. However, there are code paths within those functions that do not require Ether.

## Impact
Any Ethers sent mistakenly with the ERC20 tokens will be frozen on the contract balance.
The vulnerability is also a wider attack surface enabler as it can bring in the user funds to the contract balance.

Medium despite the fund loss possibility as the native funds in question here are mistakenly sent only, so the probability is lower compared to direct leakage issues.

## Code Snippet
1. `finalizeDeposit()`:
```solidity
134            } else {
135                  finalizeBridgeERC20(_l2Token, _l1Token, _from, _to, _amount, _extraData);
136            }
```

2. `_initiateWithdrawal()`:
```solidity
173        } else {
174            _initiateBridgeERC20(_l2Token, l1Token, _from, _to, _amount, _minGasLimit, _extraData);
175        }
```

This, `_initiateWithdrawal()` vulnerability affects these two functions as well:

## Tool used

Code inspection

## Recommendation
Consider reverting when these functions with non-native targets are called with a non-zero native amount added.
Add a `require(0 == msg.value)` for the above conditions
