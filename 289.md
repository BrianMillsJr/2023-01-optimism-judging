# # [M-02] Gas grieffing attack while bridging NFT

## Summary

In
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L1ERC721Bridge.sol#L68

the external call:

               IERC721(_localToken).safeTransferFrom(address(this), _to, _tokenId);

it is vulnerable to a gas grieffing attack because the \_to address is not always a trusted receiver. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Case where it is vulnerable:
The bridging functionality is used by whatever project/protocol. So, there is a intermediary. And they trigger the calls for the users in their platform passing the \_to address as the user address that he inputs.

The address, is a smart contract that has a onERC721Received function that loads lot of data in memory. So, the transaction will be much higher in gas cost for the intermediary.

## Impact

Theft of gas/increase gas cost for protocols/intermediaries

## Tool used 
Manual Review



## Recommendation

Add some limite\ to the gas that can be used in the external call.
