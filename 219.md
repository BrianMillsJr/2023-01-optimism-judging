# `getL2OutputIndexAfter()` returns output regardless of the validity of input `_l2BlockNumber`

## Summary
In L2OutputOracle.sol, [`getL2OutputIndexAfter()`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/3f4b3c328153a8aa03611158b6984d624b17c1d9/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol#L236-L262) is supposed to return the index of the L2 output that checkpoints a given L2 block number. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is that the function `getL2OutputIndexAfter()` could return an erroneous index, even if `_l2BlockNumber` does not exist in [`l2Outputs`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/3f4b3c328153a8aa03611158b6984d624b17c1d9/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol#L50). 

## Impact
This could lead to confusion and mess up with future implementations dependent on `getL2OutputIndexAfter()`.

## Code Snippet
In the code snippet below, `arr` is typical of a scenario where the elements between 5 and 11 have been deleted via [`deleteL2Outputs()`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/3f4b3c328153a8aa03611158b6984d624b17c1d9/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/L2OutputOracle.sol#L128-L148). 

If you were to input an already deleted element, say 7, which is non-existent, it will return index 5. Additionally, it will return index 9 for any element that is greater than 15.

```solidity
contract Storage {

    uint[] arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15];

    function bee() public view returns(uint[] memory) {
        return arr;
    }

   function foo(uint blockNumber) public view returns(uint){
        // Find the output via binary search, guaranteed to exist.
        uint256 lo = 0;
        uint256 hi = arr.length;
        while (lo < hi) {
            uint256 mid = (lo + hi) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] < blockNumber) {
                lo = mid + 1;
            } else {
                hi = mid;
            }
        }

        return lo;
   }

}
```

## Recommendation
Consider using mapping to have `_l2BlockNumber` mapped to `Types.OutputProposal`.
