# # [M-03] Insufficient validation while initializing

## Summary

In the following function:

      https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/SystemConfig.sol#L110-L125

       function initialize(
      address \_owner,
      uint256 \_overhead,
     uint256 \_scalar,
     bytes32 \_batcherHash,
      uint64 \_gasLimit,
      address \_unsafeBlockSigner
      ) public initializer {
       require(\_gasLimit >= MINIMUM_GAS_LIMIT, "SystemConfig: gas limit 
     too low");
     \_\_Ownable_init();
     transferOwnership(\_owner);
     overhead = \_overhead;
      scalar = \_scalar;
     batcherHash = \_batcherHash;
      gasLimit = \_gasLimit;
      \_setUnsafeBlockSigner(\_unsafeBlockSigner);
        }

there is no validation for the \_owner and \_unsafeBlockSigner addresses. 

## Vulnerability Detail

It does not check if owner is not 0 and \_unsafeBlockSigner is not 0, meaning that if there is an error ownership will be transferes to address(0), losign ownership of the contract.

## Impact

Losign ownership of the contract due to no input validation. The medium severity is granted due to code4rena similar reports that are medium severity. Example: https://solodit.xyz/issues/3537

## Tool used 
Manual Review


## Recommendation

Add require statements such as:

     require(_owner != address(0), "SystemConfig: owner is the zero address");
     require(_unsafeBlockSigner != address(0), "SystemConfig: _unsafeBlockSigner is the zero address");
