# `SystemDictator` can be front-runned

## Summary

`SystemDictator` contract is one of the key contracts that manage the migration process. The lack of access control on the `SystemDictator.initialize` function might result in the initialization of the `SystemDictator` contract being front-runned.

## Vulnerability Detail

The lack of access control on the `SystemDictator.initialize` function might result in the initialization of the `SystemDictator` contract being front-runned by malicious users.

```solidity
File: SystemDictator.sol
145:     /**
146:      * @param _config System configuration.
147:      */
148:     function initialize(DeployConfig memory _config) public initializer {
149:         config = _config;
150:         currentStep = 1;
151:         __Ownable_init();
152:         _transferOwnership(config.globalConfig.controller);
153:     }
```

## Impact

Malicious users or competitors could attempt to DOS the migration process by front-running the `SystemDictator` contract causing reputation damage, delaying the migration, and causing griefing to the OP team.

It might result in the OP team needing to re-deploy the `SystemDictator` contract during the migration process.

## Recommendation

Implement access control on the `initialize` function to ensure only authorized users can call the function.
