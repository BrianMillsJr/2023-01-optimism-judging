# Increasing the volume of bridging fraudulently

## Summary

It is possible to increase the volume of bridging transaction significantly. It can be done by getting a flash loan of USDC (for example) and transfers this large amount between L1/L2 but in reality this large amount only is deposited in bridge contract on L1 and in the same transaction it is withdrawn to repay the flash loan. But, it seems that the user is bridging large amount between L1 and L2. 

## Vulnerability Detail

 - Bob (a malicious user) creates a fake ERC20 token contract (called `FakeL2Token`) on L2, and mints `1_000_000 * 10 ** 6` to himself.
 - Bob creates a contract (called `BobL1Contract`) on L1.
 - Bob calls the function `bridgeERC20To` on L2 to bridge `1_000_000 * 10 ** 6` of `FakeL2Token` to L1, with following parameters:
   - `_localToken` = address of `FakeL2Token` on L2
   - `_remoteToken` = address of USDC on L1
   - `_to` = address of `BobL1Contract` on L1
   - `_amount` = 1_000_000 * 10 ** 6
   - `_minGasLimit` = 0
   - `_extraData` = ""
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/StandardBridge.sol#L265-L272
 - Then the internal function `_initiateBridgeERC20` will be called.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/StandardBridge.sol#L397
 - Since `FakeL2Token` is not Optimism Mintable ERC20, the `else block` will be executed, in which we will have:
 ```solidity
deposits[FakeL2Token][USDC] = 1_000_000 * 10 ** 6;
```
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/StandardBridge.sol#L413
 - After validation, and challenge period elapsed, on the L1 side, the function `finalizeBridgeERC20` will be called.
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/StandardBridge.sol#L324
 - Since USDC is not Optimism Mintable ERC20, the `else block` will be executed. But, it will be reverted, because the mapping `deposits[USDC][FakeL2Token] = 0`, so it can not unlock 1_000_000 * 10 ** 6 USDC. 
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/StandardBridge.sol#L339
 - Since, the finalization was not successful, it is possible to retry finalization again later.
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L331
 - `BobL1Contract` takes a flash loan of 1_000_000 * 10 ** 6 USDC from AAVE.
 - In the same transaction, `BobL1Contract` calls the function `bridgeERC20To` on L1 with the following parameters:
    - `_localToken` = address of USDC on L1
   - `_remoteToken` = address of `FakeL2Token` on L2 
   - `_to` = address of Bob
   - `_amount` = 1_000_000 * 10 ** 6
   - `_minGasLimit` = 0
   - `_extraData` = ""
 - Since USDC is not Optimism Mintable ERC20, 1_000_000 * 10 ** 6 USDC will be transferred from `BobL1Contract` to the `L1StandardBridge`, and we will have:
```solidity
deposits[USDC][FakeL2Token] = 1_000_000 * 10 ** 6;
```
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/StandardBridge.sol#L415
 - In the same transaction, `BobL1Contract` retries the finalization of the previous failed transaction by calling the function `relayMessage`. 
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L256
 - Since the mapping `deposits[USDC][FakeL2Token]` has the value of 1_000_000 * 10 ** 6 (because of the previous bridge initiation), this time the ERC20 bridging will be finalized properly, and this amount will be transferred to `BobL1Contract`, and we will have `deposits[USDC][FakeL2Token] = 0`.
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-optimism/blob/main/optimism/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/universal/StandardBridge.sol#L341
 - In the same transaction, `BobL1Contract` repays the flash loan to AAVE.
 - On the L2 side, the same amount 1_000_000 * 10 ** 6 `FakeL2Token` will be transferred to Bob.

## Impact
 - It may have some impact on the robots (defenders, like what implemented by OpenZeppelin) who monitors the deposit and withdrawal amount continuously. For example, if a robot is monitoring the Optimism bridges to see if some large amount of funds are being transferred between L1/L2 to do some action (like setting off an alarm or pausing some critical functions), it will lead to false alarm.
 - Moreover, Bob can increase his volume of transaction with optimism fraudulently, and can increase his chance of getting airdrop (if any) significantly.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe one solution is to check that at least one of the tokens (remote or local) be Optimism Mintable ERC20 on one of the chains. For example, Since USDC is not Optimism Mintable ERC20, then `FakeL2Token` must be Optimism Mintable ERC20 on L2.
```solidity
function finalizeBridgeERC20(
        address _localToken,
        address _remoteToken,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes calldata _extraData
    ) public onlyOtherBridge {
        if (_isOptimismMintableERC20(_localToken)) {
            require(
                _isCorrectTokenPair(_localToken, _remoteToken),
                "StandardBridge: wrong remote token for Optimism Mintable ERC20 local token"
            );

            OptimismMintableERC20(_localToken).mint(_to, _amount);
        } else {
            require(_isOptimismMintableERC20OnRemoteChain(_remoteToken), "at least one token must be Optimism Mintable ERC20");
            deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] = deposits[_localToken][_remoteToken] - _amount;
            IERC20(_localToken).safeTransfer(_to, _amount);
        }

        emit ERC20BridgeFinalized(_localToken, _remoteToken, _from, _to, _amount, _extraData);
    }
```
