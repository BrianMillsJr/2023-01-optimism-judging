# [Draft] Deposit transactions should not be allowed to be submitted via RPC

## Summary

Bedrock introduces a new Deposit transaction type which is only intended to be initiated on the L1 and included in the L2 as part of the L1 block derivation. Deposit transactions may also have a field `isSystemTransaction` set to true to disable gas metering.

While most OP Geth other than the sequencer does not do anything with the transactions in its local txpool, the actual sequencer will collect pending transactions in the txpool to form the next L2 block. It is important not to allow users to submit raw Deposit transactions, especially not allow users to submit over RPC deposit transactions with `isSystemTransaction` set to True and use infinite gas to stall the mining process.

## Impact

## Code Snippet
`eth_sendRawTransaction` public RPC ultimately calls into SendRawTransaction()

`IsSystemTransaction` gas limit bypass if set to true
