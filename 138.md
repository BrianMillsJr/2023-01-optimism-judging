# Optimism Portal can run out of gas due to incorrect overhead estimation

## Summary

In contrast to `CrossDomainMessenger` which has a 5k gas buffer, the Optimism Portal doesn't, meaning all its relayed calls will have 5k+ less gas than intended.

This forces integrations (Bridge) to spend more gas by default, because of a logic flaw.

For this reason am filing the finding as Medium Severity:
- Programming Mistake (Math is incorrect)
- Call forwards less gas than intended and can revert because of it

Optimism Portal doesn't have it

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recompute the buffer to add the extra 5k + the overhead of the SLOAD (in the few hundreds of gas)
